Notes: This code displays the usage of methods, one of which includes the famous disks of datang. In the
puzzle, there are three pegs, with several disks on the first peg. The disks are arranged in
order of decreasing diameter, with the largest disk on the bottom and the smallest disk on
top. The rules of the puzzle require that only one disk may be moved at a time, from one
peg to another, and that a larger disk may never be placed on top of a smaller disk. The
objective is to move the entire tower of disks from the first peg to the second peg.
