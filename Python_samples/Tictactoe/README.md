# TIC TAC TOE

This is a  basic tictactoe game with the base program given by the professor.
Students were required to program board and player classes.
For extra credit students can create AI and smart AI player subclasses.

This program was written 4 years after my original ruby tictactoe program, with a noticable increase of code quality and sophisticaiton.
